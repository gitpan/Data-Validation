Description
    This module implements filters and common constraints in builtin methods
    and uses a factory pattern to implement an extensible list of external
    filters and constraints

    Data values are filtered first before testing against the constraints.
    The filtered data values are returned if they conform to the
    constraints, otherwise an exception is thrown

Configuration and Environment
    The following are passed to the constructor

    exception
       Class capable of throwing an exception. Should provide an *args*
       attribute

    constraints
       Hash containing constraint attributes. Keys are the $id values passed
       to "check_field". See Data::Validation::Constraints

    fields
       Hash containing field definitions. Keys are the $id values passed to
       "check_field". Each field definition can contain a space separated
       list of filters to apply and a space separated list of constraints.
       Each constraint method must return true for the value to be accepted

    filters
       Hash containing filter attributes. Keys are the $id values passed to
       "check_field". See Data::Validation::Filters

    operators
       Hash containing operator code refs. The keys of the hash ref are
       comparison operators and their values are the anonymous code refs
       that compare the operands and return a boolean. Used by the *compare*
       form validation method

Subroutines/Methods
  check_form
       $form = $dv->check_form( $prefix, $form );

    Calls "check_field" for each of the keys in the $form hash. In the calls
    to "check_field" the $form keys have the $prefix prepended to them to
    create the key to the $fields hash

    If one of the fields constraint names is *compare*, then the fields
    value is compared with the value for another field. The constraint
    attribute *other_field* determines which field to compare and the
    *operator* constraint attribute gives the comparison operator which
    defaults to "eq"

    All fields are checked. Multiple error objects are stored, if they
    occur, in the "args" attribute of the returned error object

  check_field
       $value = $dv->check_field( $id, $value );

    Checks one value for conformance. The $id is used as a key to the
    *fields* hash whose *validate* attribute contains the list of space
    separated constraint names. The value is tested against each constraint
    in turn. All tests must pass or the subroutine will use the *exception*
    class to "throw" an error
